# cursor-example-repo under /opt

This directory deploys to **`/opt/cursor-example-repo/`**. Repo root has **`etc/`** and **`opt/`**; the workflow clones in the Actions workspace and copies `etc/` → `/etc/`, `opt/` → `/opt/`. No `etc` dir here—system configs live under repo root **`etc/`**.

Add files here; push to deploy.
